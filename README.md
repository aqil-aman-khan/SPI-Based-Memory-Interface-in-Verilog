# SPI-Based-Memory-Interface-in-Verilog
A modular Verilog design that connects an SPI Slave to a single-port RAM, enabling full-duplex communication and memory operations over the SPI protocol.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How SPI Works
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous, full-duplex communication protocol commonly used in embedded systems. It uses four main signals:

‚Ä¢ MOSI (Master Out, Slave In) ‚Äì Serial data from master to slave

‚Ä¢ MISO (Master In, Slave Out) ‚Äì Serial data from slave to master

‚Ä¢ SCLK (Serial Clock) ‚Äì Clock signal generated by the master

‚Ä¢ SS/CS (Slave Select) ‚Äì Active-low signal to select the target slave

In This Project:

1. The master sends 10-bit commands via MOSI, including 2-bit control and 8-bit address/data.

2. The interface module decodes commands and routes them to the RAM.

3. Data can be written to or read from the memory module.

4. Read results are sent back to the master through MISO.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project includes:
1. slave.v ‚Äî SPI Slave implementation

2. memory.v ‚Äî Single-port synchronous RAM (256-depth)

3. interface.v ‚Äî Connects SPI to RAM, handles command decoding

4. test_bench.v ‚Äî Testbench for simulation and verification

## üß™ Simulation
You can simulate this project using Xilinx Vivado:
1. Open Vivado and create a new project.

2. Add all source files (slave.v, memory.v, interface.v) and the testbench (test_bench.v).

3. Set test_bench.v as the top module for simulation.

4. Run behavioral simulation to verify SPI memory operations.

5. Use the waveform viewer to inspect SPI transactions, RAM read/write activity, and internal signals.
